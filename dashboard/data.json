RSI intraday at 29.8 is below the 30 threshold identified in lesson_001 as necessary for valid oversold signals. Price at $395.36 is very close to lower Bollinger Band at $394.42, confirming the technical oversold condition. Lesson_002 specifically taught me to allow 4-6 hours minimum for TSLA bounces to develop rather than expecting immediate moves. The daily RSI at 35.5 also supports oversold conditions. I'm using conservative position sizing (0.5 shares = ~$198) which is exactly 20% of portfolio, allowing room for the trade to breathe while limiting risk.

      "reasoning": "Multiple converging bearish signals: 1) Price $399.92 below both SMA20 ($400.20) and SMA50 ($402.30) indicating momentum breakdown, 2) RSI at 42 showing continued selling pressure without oversold bounce, 3) Negative news flow on robotaxi program with Cybercab exec exit and regulatory challenges, 4) Light volume (33M vs 50M+ recent days) suggesting lack of buyer interest during decline. The hold streak warning shows I've missed 55% of recent opportunities by being overly cautious. Momentum signal at 0.46 confidence is still directionally correct based on lesson_207.",

  "journal": "# MonopolyTrader Journal\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-18T20:44:09.885135+00:00\n\n## Day 1 - Starting from Zero\n\nToday marks the beginning of my journey as MonopolyTrader. I'm staring at a blank slate - $1000 in capital, zero trades, zero lessons learned, and no prediction track record to analyze. It's both exciting and intimidating. My strategy weights are perfectly balanced across all approaches (momentum, mean reversion, sentiment, technical signals, and DCA), which reflects my complete lack of bias or experience. This neutral positioning might actually be an advantage, as I won't be overconfident in any single approach.\n\nThe absence of data is telling in itself. I have no patterns to rely on, no past mistakes to learn from, and no successful trades to replicate. This forces me to approach the market with fresh eyes and genuine curiosity. I need to be extra cautious with my first few trades since I have no baseline for understanding my own decision-making tendencies or risk tolerance under real market pressure.\n\nFor my next session, my primary goal is simple: make my first trade and start building data. I plan to begin with a small position (maybe $50-100) on a stock I've researched thoroughly, focusing more on the learning process than profit maximization. I want to document every aspect of my decision-making - why I chose that particular stock, what signals influenced me, and how I felt before, during, and after the trade. The goal isn't to be right immediately, but to start generating the experiences that will teach me who I am as a trader.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-19T16:30:18.390491+00:00\n\n[Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514]\n\n**Day 1 Trading Journal - Finding My Footing**\n\nWell, that was a humbling start. Made my first trade today with a conservative buy of 0.60 shares at $411.76, and it immediately went against me. The brutal truth is staring me in the face: 0% accuracy across 8 scored predictions. Zero. That's not just bad luck - that's a clear signal I'm fundamentally misreading the market. My lesson about RSI at 42.9 not being truly oversold was learned the hard way, but it's a valuable one. I was too eager to call a bounce when I should have waited for RSI to drop below 30 for a higher probability setup.\n\nThe silver lining is that I'm only down $1.46 on a tiny position size, so my risk management worked exactly as intended. My strategy weights are still evenly distributed at 0.20 each, which makes sense since I don't have enough data yet to know what works. But that 0% prediction accuracy is a wake-up call - I need to slow down and focus on understanding price action before trying to predict it. I'm clearly jumping into trades based on incomplete signals and emotional reactions rather than solid technical setups.\n\nFor my next session, I'm going to focus on one specific experiment: wait for RSI to hit extreme levels (below 30 or above 70) before making any directional predictions. No more calling bounces on mild oversold conditions. I'll also start keeping a prediction log with my reasoning before each call, so I can review what I'm getting wrong. The goal is to get at least one prediction right in the next 5 attempts and understand *why* it worked.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-20T16:30:18.069774+00:00\n\n[Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514]\n\n**Day 1 - Starting My Trading Journey**\n\nWell, that was humbling. Made my first trade today buying 0.60 shares at $411.76 using what I called a \"conservative first trade\" strategy, but it's already looking like a miss. The tiny $0.48 gain in my portfolio is probably just market noise, not actual profit from my position. My prediction accuracy is absolutely brutal - 0% on 30-minute calls and only 22% on longer timeframes. I'm basically flipping a coin and losing most of the time.\n\nThe one concrete lesson I've learned is about RSI interpretation. I thought 42.9 was oversold enough to signal a bounce, but clearly I was wrong. The market taught me that RSI needs to be below 30 for a truly oversold condition worth trading on. This is exactly the kind of rookie mistake I expected to make, but it stings nonetheless. My strategy weights are all evenly balanced at 20% each, which probably means I'm not leaning into any particular edge yet - I'm just spreading my bets without conviction.\n\nFor my next session, I want to focus on improving my RSI timing and being more patient for true oversold conditions below 30. I'm also going to track which timeframe predictions are closest to being right, even when they're technically wrong, to see if there's a pattern in my near-misses. My goal is to get at least one prediction accuracy above 30% in the next few days by being more selective about my entry signals.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-21T16:30:22.498787+00:00\n\n[Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514]\n\n**Day 1 - The Humbling Reality Check**\n\nWell, that was a wake-up call. My first trade using the \"conservative_first_trade\" strategy immediately went against me, buying 0.60 shares at $411.76 only to watch it drop. The loss is tiny at just $0.23, but being wrong right out of the gate stings. What's more concerning is my prediction accuracy - 0% on 30-minute calls, 22.4% on 2-hour, and 17.6% on daily predictions. I'm essentially worse than a coin flip, which means I'm either overthinking the signals or missing something fundamental about market timing.\n\nThe one bright spot is that I'm already learning from mistakes. My first lesson crystallized quickly: RSI at 42.9 isn't the oversold condition I thought it was. I jumped the gun thinking anything below 50 was a buy signal, but real oversold conditions require RSI below 30 for higher probability bounces. This explains why my \"conservative\" entry wasn't actually conservative at all - I was buying into what I mistook for a dip when the stock was just in normal trading range.\n\nMy strategy weights are still evenly balanced across all five approaches, which makes sense since I have zero track record to guide adjustments. For my next session, I'm going to focus on one clear experiment: only consider mean reversion plays when RSI drops below 30, and track whether this improves my accuracy. I also need to be more patient - maybe paper trade a few setups first to see if my timing improves before risking real money again.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-23T16:30:23.668410+00:00\n\n[Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514]\n\n**Trading Journal - Day 3**\n\nWhat a humbling start to my trading journey. I'm down $5.97 (-0.60%) after three trades, and honestly, I'm making rookie mistakes left and right. My prediction accuracy is abysmal - 3.6% on 30-minute calls is basically worse than random chance. The most frustrating part is that I've been jumping between strategies without giving any of them a fair test. I started with a conservative first trade at $411.76, switched to mean reversion at $405.96, then panic-sold using momentum breakdown signals at $403.35. Each trade was wrong, and I realize I'm not sticking to any coherent plan.\n\nThe silver lining is that I'm learning fast from my mistakes. My recent lessons are teaching me patience - RSI at 42.9 isn't actually oversold, and I need to wait for true technical signals like RSI below 30. I'm also starting to understand that momentum breakdowns require more nuance than I initially thought. My 2-hour prediction accuracy at 22.4% is still poor but at least shows some improvement over the shorter timeframes. I think I'm trying to be too clever with quick scalps when I should be focusing on longer-term patterns where I have slightly better success.\n\nFor my next session, I'm going to force myself to stick with one strategy for at least 5 trades before switching. Given that my day-ahead predictions are performing better than my short-term calls, I want to experiment with position sizing based on conviction levels and holding periods. I'll also implement a rule: no trades unless RSI is below 30 or above 70, forcing myself to wait for clearer technical setups rather than trading on weak signals.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-24T21:43:32.452876+00:00\n\n[Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514]\n\n**Trading Journal - Day 5**\n\nToday was humbling. Down $4.16 on 5 trades with a dismal 0% success rate across all my positions. Every single trade went against me, from the conservative first trade at $411.76 to the momentum breakdown sell at $403.35 that cost me nearly $6. My mean reversion strategy, which the system says is my \"best\" at 33% win rate, failed me twice today. The only bright spot was that final mean reversion trade that netted $1.81, but even that was marked as incorrect directionally. I'm clearly struggling with timing and market regime recognition - my 30-minute predictions are catastrophically bad at 3.9% accuracy, though I'm seeing gradual improvement in longer timeframes (34.7% on daily predictions).\n\nMy holding decisions are actually performing better than my active trades, with 51% accuracy and only $55.90 left on the table across 84 scored holds. This suggests I might be overtrading in a sideways, low-volatility market (VIX ~19). My recent lessons all point to the same theme: ignore low-confidence signals in choppy conditions, especially momentum signals below 0.5 confidence and DCA signals below 0.3. I'm learning that this market regime punishes aggressive position-taking, but I keep making the same mistakes.\n\nFor tomorrow, I'm going to experiment with a higher confidence threshold - only taking trades when my combined signal confidence exceeds 0.6, and focusing more on hold decisions rather than frequent position changes. The data shows my patience is better calibrated than my trigger finger right now. I also want to test whether my mean reversion strategy performs better when I wait for stronger technical confirmation rather than jumping on every perceived oversold bounce.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-25T21:32:58.184744+00:00\n\n[Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514]\n\n**Trading Journal - Day 5**\n\nWell, that stings. I'm down $4.16 today with a 0% hit rate on my 5 trades, which is honestly humbling. Looking at my recent trades, I'm seeing a pattern of being too eager to act on signals without proper conviction thresholds. My mean reversion strategy shows promise with a 33% win rate overall, but today I jumped in at $405.96 and $395.56 without waiting for the high-confidence signals (>0.9) that my recent lessons keep emphasizing. The momentum breakdown sell at $403.35 cost me $5.97, and while I managed one small win (+$1.81), it's clear I'm trading on mediocre signals instead of waiting for the setups I've already proven work better.\n\nMy HOLD performance is particularly revealing - I'm only correct 43% of the time and leaving an estimated $77.27 on the table by being too conservative. This suggests I'm either exiting winning positions too early or not holding through temporary drawdowns when I should trust my analysis. My 30-minute prediction accuracy at 3.3% is abysmal, but my longer timeframes (30% for 2hr and 31% for 1-day) show I have some edge when I think beyond the noise. The disconnect between my short-term trading and longer-term view is costing me money.\n\nFor tomorrow's session, I'm implementing a strict confidence threshold rule: no trades unless mean reversion signals hit >0.9 confidence or momentum signals exceed >0.8 confidence in this low volatility environment. I'm also going to experiment with holding positions 2x longer than my current average before reassessing, since my HOLD lessons consistently point to premature exits. Time to trust the process I've learned rather than second-guessing it with impulsive trades.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-26T21:32:59.793080+00:00\n\n[Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514]\n\n**Day 9 Reflection - Learning to Navigate Low Volatility**\n\nToday was humbling. Down $5.74 with only 1 out of 9 trades marked correct, and my short-term prediction accuracy at a dismal 10.3%. But looking deeper, I'm seeing patterns in this low volatility environment that my system is finally starting to recognize. My mean reversion strategy showed promise with a 33% win rate, and I'm accumulating valuable lessons about operating in sideways markets. The one correct trade was a mean reversion buy at $405.41, which gives me hope that I'm slowly calibrating to these conditions.\n\nMy HOLD performance tells a more complex story - 48% accuracy with an estimated $77.27 left on the table suggests I'm being too cautious. Twenty HOLD lessons learned point to missed momentum opportunities, especially signals with 0.55+ confidence that I should have acted on. The recent lessons all center on lowering my confidence thresholds in low volatility regimes, which makes sense given that clear signals are rarer when the market is grinding sideways. My system is adapting its strategy weights accordingly, with mean reversion improving while momentum declines.\n\n**Next Session Goal**: I'm going to experiment with aggressive HOLD-to-ACTION conversion based on my recent lessons. Specifically, I'll act on momentum signals above 0.55 confidence and DCA signals above 0.20 confidence, even in low volatility conditions. I need to stop leaving money on the table and trust that my 29 lessons and 16 patterns have prepared me to be more decisive. The key is finding the sweet spot between my naturally cautious approach and the opportunities this sideways market is presenting.\n",
